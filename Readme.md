# Error approximation

This repo is dedicated to estimating the maximum value of a batch with N components using Chebyshev approximation.

## Project Structure
The source directory of this project contains multiple python scripts, some of them for generating datasets, some of them for plotting. The `data` folder contains multiple
datasets and their approximation of the maximum values of a given batch using chebyshev approximation.
